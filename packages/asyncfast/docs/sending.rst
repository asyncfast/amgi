 Sending

Sending can be achieved by yielding a message to send:

.. async-fast-example:: examples/send_dict.py

The most dynamic method is to use a ``dict``, with the ``dict`` form being:

:address (``str``):
   The address to send the message

:payload (``bytes | None``):
   The payload of the message to send

:headers (``list[tuple[bytes, bytes]]``):
   The headers to send with the message

While this is useful, the type cannot be inferred for documentation generation. To do this the class ``Message`` must be
used.

The ``Message`` class uses the classes annotations to discover the types of a message. The equivalent of the above
example would be:

.. async-fast-example:: examples/send_message.py

This follows the same rules as setting up a receiver. For example, one payload, and using annotated types for headers.
